            I developed a power system model to simulate the performance of a
            new power plant. The model was used to identify potential problems
            and to optimize the design of the plant.

            I thrive on guiding and mentoring study teams to address critical
            operational and planning challenges faced by transmission utilities,
            generating stations, and renewable energy projects. I have
            successfully completed over 100 projects, totaling more than 20 GW
            of capacity, tackling a wide range of issues including planning,
            dynamic stability, power quality, and grid compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my leadership, I guide and mentor a team of engineers in
            conducting power system studies, planning activities, and grid
            interconnection studies. My goal is to foster a collaborative
            environment where innovation and knowledge sharing flourish,
            ensuring optimal solutions for every project.
